                  <h1>Congressional Net Worth is Too Damn High</h1>
                  <p style="position: left">Let's dive headfirst into the 1%ers cash-filled pools.  While the average American family is making $59,039 annually, most of our faithful congressional representatives are netting millions. These elected officials are the voice of the American people and are responsible for making laws that influence our daily lives, but how can they understand the strife of the American family when they earn 12 times the average household income?!</p>

                <p>The map above displays the wealthiest congressional representative of each state. The industries in which they built their wealth range from real estate, mining to technology. The greener the state, the more millions the representative has. Net worth is calculated based on investments, real estate, trusts, and bank accounts. There is no state whose richest representative is not a millionaire.</p>

<table width="100%">
           <tr><h3>#1 Darrell Issa</h3>With a whopping $283.3 million net worth, Representative Darrell Issa of California is the richest member of Congress. He is a Republican who made his riches in the 1990s while leading Directed Electronics Inc., a Vista-based manufacturer of vehicle antitheft devices that he created. Darrell has been an open Trump supporter, earning him multiple anti-Trump protests at his district office. Because he pitied us poor peons, he declared he would not be running for re-election. <a href= "https://issa.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Darrell Issa.</a><p></p>
          </tr>
        
          <tr>
           <h3>#2 Greg Gianforte</h3>
           A surprising but not close second, Montana Representative Greg Gianforte's current net worth is estimated at $135.7 million. He is a Republican who has profited in the technology and data analytics industries. The highlight of his 2017 year in office was body-slamming a reporter during a press conference. The reporter was uninvited and "checked" at the door.  Don't mess with Montana because while Greg may have millions, he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. <a href= "https://gianforte.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Greg Gianforte.</a><p></p>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <h3>#3 Jared Polis</h3> A close second to Gianforte, Representative Jared Polis of Colorado has a net worth of $122.6 million. Jared Polis is the richest Democrat in Congress, who founded American Information Systems and co-founded ProFlowers.com and BlueMountain.com. In November 2018, it was announced that he had won the campaign for governor of Colorado. He will be the nation's first openly gay man to be governor, which is a follow-up success to becoming the first openly gay man elected to the House in 2008. While serving, he pushed for universal health care and free early childhood education. Good Guy Jared for the win. <a href= "https://polis.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Jared Polis.</a> <p></p>
          </tr>
         
          <tr><h3>#4 David Trott</h3> Representative David Trott of Michigan has a net worth of $119.1 million. Trott is a Republican and a real son of a bitch. He transformed his parents' small law office, Trott & Trott, into a real estate behemoth with thousands of portfolios of bad mortgages. At the height of the last decadeâ€™s housing crisis, the company evicted almost 80,000 a year in Michigan alone. WHO ELECTED THIS DUDE?! The good news is he did not run for re-election in 2018 due to his opposition to President Trump. <a href= "https://trott.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about David Trott.</a><p></p>
          </tr>

          <tr>
           <h3>#5 Michael McCaul</h3>Closing out the Top 5 list is Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, who has a net worth of $113 million. Michael McCaul founded Clear Channel Communications, which transformed into iHeartCommunications. He is a ticket-voting Republican, which has really won the hearts of Texans everywhere.  Michael has served seven terms in Congress -- winning one re-election because no Democrat candidate even filed. <a href= "https://mccaul.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Michael McCaul.</a><p></p>

                <p>The map above visualizes the disparity between the wealth in Congress and the average American family's household income. The redder the state, the higher the income disparity between the net worth of its wealthiest congressional representative and the family median income. The state with the least disparity is Minnesota where the wealthiest representative makes 26 times the average citizen's annual income! </p>

                <h3>In Conclusion</h3>  
                <p>Wealth in Congress has risen to exorbitant levels, with many congressional representatives belonging to the 1%. This creates an awkward situation for the rest of us trying to just pursue a life debt free while being beaten down by our student loan debt. Our wealthiest congressional representatives don't know how to not make money and they bring that money lust to Washington, but nothing is trickling down. We constantly hear jobs, jobs, jobs but those newly created jobs continue to exploit lower income earners while lining the pockets of our faithful 1%ers. The sad truth is that there is not much we can do to change this without a constitutional amendment to make elections publicly funded in order to eliminate the corrupting influence of Big Money campaign contributions. Unless we make this change, the monied special interests will continue to spend millions to elect millionaire candidates who will do their bidding, while ignoring or simply paying lip service to the people they are supposed to be representing.  </p>
