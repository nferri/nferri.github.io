He is a Replubican who made his riches in the 1990s while leading Directed Electronics Inc., a Vista-based manufacturer of vehicle antitheft devices that he created. Darrell has been an open Trump-supporter, gaining a following of anti-Trump protests at his California-based office. Because he pitties us poor peons, he has declared he will not be running for re-election. <a href= "https://issa.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Darrell Issa.</a><p></p>

           <h3>#2 Greg Gianforte</h3>
           A surprising but not close second, Representative Greg Gianforte's of Montana current net worth is estimated at $135.7 million. He is a Replubican and who has profitted in the technology and data analytics industries. The highlight of his 2018 year in office, was body-slamming a reporter during a press conference. The reporter was un-invited and "checked" at the door.  Don't mess with Montana because while Greg may have millions, he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. <a href= "https://gianforte.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Greg Gianforte.</a><p></p>

Jared Polis is the richest Democrat in Congress who founded American Information Systems, co-founded ProFlowers.com and BlueMontain.com. In November 2018, it was announced that he won the campaign for governor of Colorado. He will be the nation's first openly gay man to be governor, which is a follow-up success to becoming the first openly-gay man elected to the House in 2008. While serving, he pushed for universal health care and free early childhood education. Good guy Jared for the win.<a href= "https://polis.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about Jared Polis.</a> <p></p>
          </tr>
         
          <tr><h3>#4 David Trott</h3> Representative David Trott of Michigan has a net worth of $119.1 million. Trott is a Republican and a real son-of-a-bitch. He transformed his parent’s small law office, Trott & Trott, into a real estate behemoth with thousands of portfolios of bad mortgages. At the height of the last decade’s housing crisis, the company evicted almost 80,000 a year in Michigan alone. WHO ELECTED THIS DUDE?! The good news is he will not be running for re-election in 2018, due to his opposition of President Trump. <a href= "https://trott.house.gov/" target="_blank">Learn more about David Trott.</a><p></p>
