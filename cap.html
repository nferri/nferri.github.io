                	<p><b>About the Work</b><br>
					         The North Carolina General Assembly has had multiple systematic attempts to redraw for majority-party advantage, including using racial gerrymandering as a tactic. This work follows redistricting of congressional districts after the 1990, 2000, and 2010 United States Decennial Census and looks at the competitiveness of each district in election years. I hypothesize that if the North Carolina General Assembly successfully gerrymandered districts to maintain party majority, there would be a lack of competition in historically Republican Party and/or Democratic Party represented districts as well as low campaign donation totals. This would be most frequently observed in districts with incumbent representation. High campaign donations would only be seen in districts with an open seats and the highest donations would be for Republican Party candidates in attempts to gain or retain a Republican representation.<br>
                    <sub>Congressional campaign donations, specifically total receipts per district candidate and total receipts by all party-affilitiated candidates, was acquired from the Federal Election Commission campaign finance online data portal. Only the Republican and Democratic party candidates were chosen for the general elections in two year increments from 2000 to 2016.</sub>

                  <p><b>Understanding What Type of Candidate is Most Successful</b></p>
                  <p>The protection of incumbents is observed in congressional elections due to incumbents growing financial advantage. An incumbent in North Carolina is successful when running for re-election when they are able to receive the highest campaign donations, as seen in 94 of the 97 incumbent re-election races. However, this was not seen after looking at the three successful elections where the challenger was elected over the incumbent. These results had the incumbent receiving the highest donations and not succeeding to the challenger. For the majority of the open seat races, the candidate who received the highest campaign donations also won the election, which supported the hypothesis that there is a positive association between campaign donations and the outcome of an election, specifically that the most money raised has influence over winning the seat. Alternatively, the only winners without the highest donations but still won the election were Republicans competing for a previously held Republican incumbencies, suggesting open seat races are more competitive than elections with an incumbent running for re-election, but not within historically Republican districts. For parties looking to gain a seat, open seat races are their best chance, compared to challenging an incumbent. But in order to have a successful outcome, the candidate must have the highest donations to be favored.

                   <b>Suggested Future Work</b><br>
							       Studies have documented that incumbents serving on powerful congressional committees raise more funds during congressional campaigns. An interesting avenue to advance this work would analyze any changes in the patterns of giving when legislators switch committees. This analysis would investigate the influence campaign contributions suggest from PACs on influencing legislative outcomes.  <br><br>

						      <b>Software</b><br>
							      QGIS 3.6 Noosa’s plug-in cartogram3, created by Christopher Fink, was used to create anamorphic cartograms. Esri ArcPro 10.6 was used to edit, manipulate (via tools), and display data to create thematic maps. The thematic maps, bivariate and cartogram, were exported to ArcGIS online. ArcGIS online was used to create a Story Map from the exported webmap. D3.js was used to create interactive graphs adapted from FlowingData’s “Animated Square Pie Tutorial” by Nathan Yau. </p>
