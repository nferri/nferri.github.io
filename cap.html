                	<p><b>About the Work</b><br>
					         The North Carolina General Assembly has had multiple systematic attempts to redraw for majority-party advantage, including using racial gerrymandering as a tactic. This work follows redistricting of congressional districts after the 1990, 2000, and 2010 United States Decennial Census and looks at the competitiveness of each district in election years. I hypothesize that if the North Carolina General Assembly successfully gerrymandered districts (as determined by Polsby-Popper compactness scores, link to maps above) to maintain party majority, there would be a lack of competition in historically Republican and Democratic districts accompanied by low campaign donation totals. This scenario would be most frequently observed in districts with incumbent representation. High campaign donations would only be seen in districts with an open seat, with Republican party candidates receiving high donations in a strategic attempt to gain or retain Republican representation.<br>  

                  
                   <p> Congressional campaign donations, specifically total receipts per district candidate and total receipts by all party affiliated candidates, were acquired from the Federal Election Commission campaign finance online data portal. Only the Republican and Democratic party candidates were chosen for the general elections in two-year increments from 2000 to 2016.

                  <p><b>Understanding Which Type of Candidate is Most Successful</b></p>
                  <p>TThe protection of incumbents is observed in congressional elections due to incumbents financial advantage. An incumbent in North Carolina is successful when running for re-election when receiving the highest campaign donations, as seen in 94 of the 97 incumbent re-election races. However, this pattern was not observed in the three elections where the challenger was elected over the incumbent. These results had the incumbent receiving the highest donations yet not defeating the challenger. For the majority of open seat races, the candidate who received the highest campaign donations also won the election, which supports the hypothesis that there is a positive association between campaign donations and the outcome of an election, specifically that the most money raised generally results in winning the seat. Alternatively, the only winners without the highest donations but who still won the election were Republicans competing for previously held Republican incumbencies, suggesting open seat races are more competitive than elections with an incumbent running for re-election, except within historically Republican districts. For parties looking to gain a seat, open seat races are their best chance, compared to challenging an incumbent. But in order to have a successful outcome, the candidate must have the highest donations to be favored.

    			      <b>Software</b><br>
							      QGIS 3.6 Noosa and Esri ArcGIS Pro 10.6 were the main software used to create thematic maps highlighted in this project. QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data (QGIS 2019).  Part of the Esri Geospatial Cloud, ArcGIS Pro is a single desktop GIS application. ArcGIS Pro is tightly coupled with the ArcGIS platform supporting data sharing across ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise through Web GIS (Esri). QGIS 3.6 Noosa’s plug-in cartogram3, created by Christopher Fink, was used to create anamorphic cartograms. Esri ArcPro 10.6 was used to edit, manipulate (via tools), and display data to create thematic maps. The thematic maps, bivariate and cartogram, were exported to ArcGIS online. ArcGIS online was used to create a Story Map from the exported webmap. D3.js was used to create interactive graphs adapted from FlowingData’s “Animated Square Pie Tutorial” by Nathan Yau.
